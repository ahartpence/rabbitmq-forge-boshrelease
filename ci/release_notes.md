# Improvements

* Updates routing release to v0.275.0 in the deployment manifests (due to [this bug](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/blob/develop/docs/go-1.20-expect-100-continue-known-issue.md) in v0.266.0).

* Updates references to the rabbitmq-metrics-emitter boshrelease in its new home under cloudfoundry-community github org.
